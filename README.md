# this is not a POE module

This is (or will be) a fully-featured IRCd. Why is that so surprising? People keep saying, "omg there is a POE module for ircd y r u making 1,"
but that fails and is very simple whereas this is completely customizable and packed with features. It's like asking one of the hundreds of 
people who have developed IRCds in C, "why are you writing an IRCd when there already is one?" I would guess that they were taking something and
making it better and better. I have also been told that "I don't like it" isn't a good enough reason not to use something, and that I must explain
why I don't like things. I guess I just never knew that I'm not allowed to create my own things if someone else has already created something
similar. besides, I don't want to set up an IRCd for any particular reason. I want to make one, so that is what I'm doing. (and have been for over a year)

## and just another FYI

this IRCd uses all core Perl modules. :)

## also

this is temporary. until this version of the IRCd is somewhat usable, this README probably won't help much. Basically this is an even more
customizable version of juno 2. It also has a server linking protocol now.
