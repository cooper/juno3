Development log
---------------

juno3 versions consist of three parts. major.minor.commit. Because juno is constantly developed,
increasing the version for even the smallest changes helps track errors. Only six commits are in a
minor, and only nine minors are in a major - the minor increases for every six changes. (up to 5,
starting at 0.) Using this system, it's likely that an entire minor will be completed in a day.
