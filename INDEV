juno3 versions consist of three parts. major.minor.commit. Because juno is constantly developed,
increasing the version for even the smallest changes helps track errors. Only six commits are in a
minor, and only nine minors are in a major - the minor increases for every six changes. (up to 5,
starting at 0.)
